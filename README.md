# HP-EliteBook-840-G5-Sequoia-EFI
Heya heya, this is my EFI for the Hackintosh that I'm running with my 840 G5 Sequoia

## You have to unzip kexts from EFI/OC/Kexts
## And grab your desired [itlwm.kext](https://github.com/openintelwireless/itlwm/releases) or [AirportItlwm.kext](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm)

### It is important to follow [this guide](https://github.com/randomappleboi/Native-Wifi-for-Hackintoshes-with-Intel-Wireless-cards-on-macOS-sequoia) if you have an Intel wifi card and want to use native-ish wifi with iServices when booting macOS over Sonoma.

Anyway, there are my device features:

[x] Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8650U

[x] Intel HD Graphics 620

[x] Samsung 256GB PM981 NVMe SSD

[x] Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265

This is pretty much all ig

feel free to reach out to me.
